I'd be glad to help you write a readme.md file for your Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on Amazon electronics products:

**Title:** Exploratory Data Analysis of Amazon Electronics Products (Educational Project)

**Description:**

This repository contains code and visualizations for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Amazon electronics products. The data was obtained from the Blacbox tool of Helium10 and the Productfinder tool of Keepa for educational purposes only. Due to the limited dataset size, the results may not be statistically significant but serve as a learning exercise.

**Data Source:**

* Blacbox tool (Helium10)
* Productfinder tool (Keepa)

**Note:** These tools may require subscriptions or fees for access.

**Analysis Focus:**

This EDA investigates potential relationships between product price, size tier, fulfillment type (FBA vs. Merchant Fulfilled), and monthly sales.

**Code Files:**

* `amazon-product-eda.py` (or a similar filename): Contains Python code for data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

**Visualizations:**

* The visualizations generated by the code (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts) are expected to be saved as image files (e.g., PNG, JPG) in a separate folder (e.g., `visualizations`). These images will help illustrate the relationships between the analyzed variables.

**Limitations:**

* The dataset size is limited, potentially affecting the generalizability of the findings.
* The data may not be entirely representative of the broader Amazon electronics market.

**Future Work (Optional):**

* Acquire a larger dataset for more robust analysis.
* Explore additional product attributes (e.g., brand, reviews, ratings).
* Implement more advanced statistical techniques (if applicable).

**Disclaimer:**

This project is for educational purposes only and does not guarantee the accuracy or validity of the findings. The data sources and tools mentioned are subject to change or availability.
